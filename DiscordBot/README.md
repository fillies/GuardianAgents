# GuardianAgents

Repository for the AgentX Competition at Berkeley RDI.

The bot connects to the Discord server **GuardianAgentsDemo** ([join here](https://discord.gg/mM95jTty)) and manages new user onboarding. It also integrates with Langflow for moderation and rule generation (integration to be implemented in `on_message`).

## ‚ú® Features

- Welcomes new members and assigns a "Quarantine" role until proper introduction.
- Expects a specific format for introductions and assigns the "Member" role upon verification.
- Stores user data persistently in a JSON file.
- Responds to messages and logs country-based metadata for future moderation.
- Prepares messages to be sent to Langflow (integration point marked in code).
